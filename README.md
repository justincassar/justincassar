**Hey there!** ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Justin Cassar from Malta. I currently attend Middlesex University as a student to pursue an honours degree in Computer Science. My final year at the university is coming up and I'm looking forward to graduate in 2022. 

For the past 13 years, I worked within the aircraft maintenance industry and became a licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineer at a local MRO company.

## Focus

Looking to learn new technologies and more efficient methods of software development. Right now, I'm focusing on becoming more proficient on React Native. However, I still practice different programming languages and frameworks.
